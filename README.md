# Web-intro-html

Welcome to my **HTML Projects repository**! This repository contains a collection of **well-structured, clean, and professional HTML projects**, created to demonstrate my skills in web development. 

About

These projects cover a wide range of HTML concepts, including:

- Semantic HTML structure
- Headings, paragraphs, and lists
- Links, images, and tables
- Forms and inputs
- Simple layouts and content organization

Each project is designed to be **beginner-friendly yet scalable**, allowing further improvement with CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies in the future.

 Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A showcase of my web development skills
- A learning resource for beginners
- A foundation for future, more advanced projects

Future Plans

I will continuously update this repository with **new HTML projects**, including:

- Personal portfolios
- Product or landing pages
- Mini web apps
- Interactive templates (with CSS/JS enhancements later)
